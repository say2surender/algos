    "The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n",
    "The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n",
    "1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.\n",
    "3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",

    "#### Interesting facts\n",
    "There is a story about an Indian temple in Kashi Vishwanath which contains a large room with three time-worn posts in it, surrounded by 64 golden disks. Brahmin priests, acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, have been moving these disks in accordance with the immutable rules of Brahma since that time. The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle. According to the legend, when the last move of the puzzle is completed, the world will end. It is not clear whether Lucas invented this legend or was inspired by it.\n",
    "If the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves it would take them 2^64 âˆ’ 1 seconds or roughly 585 billion years to finish, which is about 42 times the current age of the Universe."
